# DeepLearning-DataScience

## Lab 1
In this project i train and test a one layer network with multi-
ple outputs to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The network is trained using mini-batch gradient descent with a cost function
that computes the cross-entropy loss of the classifier applied to the labelled
training data and an L2 regularization term on the weight matrix.

## Lab 2
Extend the previous project to a 2 layer neural network

## Lab 3
In this project i train a ConvNet to predict the language of a
surname from its spelling. The inspiration for applying a ConvNet to a string of characters is the paper
Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification.

## Lab 4
In this project i train an RNN to synthesize English text character
by character. The RNN is trained using the text from the book The Goblet of Fire by J.K. Rowling.
